# WeBridge

**A bridge library to seamlessly integrate Python, C++ and JavaScript together.**

WeBridge allows developers to call functions and exchange data across Python, C++, and JavaScript with a **single, consistent API**, eliminating the pain of writing tedious bindings or boilerplate code.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Call **Python functions from C++ or JS**, and vice versa.
- Load and use **C++ shared libraries** from Python or JavaScript.
- Execute **JavaScript modules** from Python or C++ using multiple engines (`Node.js`, `V8`, etc.).
- Automatic **type conversion** for numbers, strings, arrays, and basic objects.
- Minimal boilerplate, maximum interoperability.
- Support for **sync and async function calls** across languages (planned).
